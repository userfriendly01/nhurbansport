More than 15 percent of which (16,756) have a service-connected disability. Unfortunately, at this time, there is a lack of recreational outlets for injured and non-injured veterans in southern New Hampshire. Through sports, NH Urban Sport can offer an opportunity to maintain optimum physical health and to increase mental well being through activity and socialization.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span class=\"ql-size-small\">According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), “With good health habits and access to health care, many disabilities can be delayed or even prevented… [by] increasing physical activity, and reducing or preventing obesity can eliminate some of the underlying causes of disability.” In fact, the CDC also reports that in most cases, secondary issues like obesity, diabetes and heart disease, all of which are preventable, are a greater problem than the disability itself.</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong>With access to an affordable, accessible, and inclusive athletic and recreational organization like NH Urban Sport, we can begin to make a significant and positive impact in the lives of service members living with disabilities.</strong></p>"
